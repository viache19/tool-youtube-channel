Tools that I am using to create and download my youtube videos

 * "exportaryoutubevideo.py" : The idea is to download the youtube videos in the highest resolution. But this script is only working with Windows. I could execute it in the macOS M2, it constantly gives some kind of errors. In the mac I am finally using the tool called : Downie. URL of the app : https://software.charliemonroe.net/downie/
